 - v0.1
   - [ ] Make the GUI system work
 - v0.2
   - [ ] Make some sort of a UI, with dummy videos, channels, etc.

Some other things I can't categorize to specific versions:
 - [ ] Research how yt-dlp works
 - [ ] Add a way to make comments
   - This won't actually create comments, there will be a tab for comments where there are direct comment links
   - This can also be extended to likes and comments
